## 🎬 MARTINI Coarse-Grained Modeling of GPCRs Oligomerization in a Multi-Lipid Membrane! 🍸✨

[![Watch the Shorts](https://github.com/TheVisualHub/VisualFactory/blob/aa62d075e6a471ca173dad8fea53666b5e629b88/assets/membrane_logo.jpeg)](https://youtube.com/shorts/2bHy32RXCBc)


This educational project uses the Martini 2 coarse-grained force field.  

⚠️ Martini parameter files (e.g., `martini_v2.2.itp`, `martini_v2.0_lipids.itp`, etc.) are **not included** in this repository.  

To run the simulations, please download the required Martini files from the official website:  

👉 [https://cgmartini.nl](https://cgmartini.nl)  

After downloading, place the files in your working directory and verify that the `#include` paths in `topol.top` are correct.  

📚 For guidance on building Martini systems, refer to the following tutorial:

👉 [INSANE Martini Tutorial (GitHub)](https://github.com/msidore/tutorial_insane/blob/master/INSANE_Tutorial.ipynb).
