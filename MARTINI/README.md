Welcome to the MARTINI tutorial featuring a coarse-grained simulations of G-protein coupled receptors.  
This educational project uses the Martini 2 coarse-grained force field.  

⚠️ Martini parameter files (e.g., `martini_v2.2.itp`, `martini_v2.0_lipids.itp`, etc.) are **not included** in this repository.  

To run the simulations, please download the required Martini files from the official website:  

👉 [https://cgmartini.nl](https://cgmartini.nl)  

After downloading, place the files in your working directory and verify that the `#include` paths in `topol.top` are correct.  

📚 For guidance on building Martini systems, refer to the following tutorial:
