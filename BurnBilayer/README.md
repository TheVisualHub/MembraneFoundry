# Molecular dynamics simulation at different temperature.
	
This tutorial gives you a brief introduction to molecular simulation with GROMACS using shell programming.  
In this examples we perform molecular dynamics simulation of lipid bilayer at different temperatures. 

QUICK START: Execution of burn_bilayer.sh script on the local Linux machine will replicate the bilayer system to perform simulation of each replica at different temperature.
This tutorial can be adapted for any molecular system with specific thermal coupling.

TODO: !! the detailed readme is comming soon !!
